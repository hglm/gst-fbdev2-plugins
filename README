*** Overview ***

This repository implements a set of optimized GStreamer 1.0-based video
sink classes for framebuffers and hardware overlays, including the Linux
console framebuffer. It is implemented in a base class called
GstFramebufferSink, and a derived base class called GstFbdevFramebufferSink
for fbdev devices. These two classes are available in the library
libgstframebuffersink. An actual plugin implementation called 'fbdev2sink'
is implemented that is derived from GstFbdevFramebuffeerSink, suitable for
most Linux framebuffer devices that use fbdev. A plugin called drmsink for
the newer DRM kernel interface is also provided.

Additionally, a plugin called "sunxifbsink" for Allwinner ARM-based devices is
provided, based on GstFbdevFramebufferSink. At the moment it implements a hardware
scaling overlay for several YUY formats and BGRx.

Class schematic:

GstVideoSink -> GstFramebufferSink -> GstFbdevFramebufferSink -> GstFbdev2Sink (plugin)
                                  \                          \
                                   -> GstDrmSink (plugin)     -> GstSunxifbSink (plugin)

The GstFramebufferSink class is generic enough that other plugins could be
implemented, possibly including ones using hardware overlay APIs.

This is work-in-progress although the plugins should be quite usable in
its current form.

The main features are direct rendering into video memory (instead of
the two-pass memcpy implementation of the regular fbdevsink plugin),
support for page flipping/vsync with multiple buffers, and several
configurable properties regulating video output and Linux framebuffer
configuration.

Using video memory buffers has a disadvantage though: reading back from
the buffers is slow (video memory is often on a seperate card, in which case
reading is very slow, and in a unified memory architecture video memory is
often uncached or not optimally configured for read-back). Some movie playing
pipelines do want to read back from video memory, so in this case not using
a buffer pool but simply copying each frame from system memory (by not enabling
the buffer-pool option) will be faster. However, when videoconvert
filter is the last processing element before the sink, it is unlikely that the
video memory buffers will be read back. Software scaling elements such as
videoscale may read back from their output buffer. Other sources such as
videotestsrc never read back from the buffers and can be run at full speed
with the buffer pool enabled. The "benchmark" property can be set to true on
all derived sinks to test video memory read/write speed.

*** Installation ***

On a Debian-based system, GStreamer 1.0 and a number of associated
development packages need to be installed. These include:

	libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libglib2.0-dev
	libdrm-dev libtool autoconf

Run autogen.sh, then make, and sudo make install.

By default the plugins and library are installed into
/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0 and /usr/local/lib/. You need to set the
GST_PLUGIN_PATH environment library to /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0 for the
plugins to be recognized. Also run sudo ldconfig after installing;
/usr/local/lib must be in the ldconfig search path.

Run gst-inspect-1.0 fbdev2sink to verify everything is installed correctly.

*** Usage (fbdev2sink) ***

Example launch line:

gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc horizontal-speed=5 ! queue ! fbdev2sink buffer-pool=true \
full-screen=true fps=30 >output

This pipeline uses direct streaming into video memory (buffer-pool=true), forces
the window size to the native full-screen resolution (full-screen=true),
sets the frames per second to 30, and the text output is directed into the
file output. The queue forces the sink to use a seperate thread. If everything
is working correctly this should show a tear-free, multi-buffered scrolling image.
Verify the file "output" to see whether any features were disabled and everything
is working correctly.

gst-launch-1.0 playbin uri=file:///home/me/videos/video.mp4 \
video-sink="fbdev2sink buffer-pool=true full-screen=true \
graphics-mode=true pan-does-vsync=true" >output

This pipeline runs playbin with fbdev2sink configured with the given parameters.
Because video memory read access is slow, the following might be faster:

gst-launch-1.0 playbin uri=file:///home/me/videos/video.mp4 \
video-sink="fbdev2sink buffer-pool=false full-screen=true \
graphics-mode=true pan-does-vsync=true" >output

The property setting graphics-mode=true can be set to force console graphics
mode (KD_GRAPHICS, reducing interference from the text console and cursor,
but textmode may not always be restored in case of a crash so it is handy
to keep a utility around to restore the console to textmode (KD_TEXT). Using
the Magic-SysRq sequence Alt-SysRq-V may also help. Another reason for loss
of textmode is that the display start address is not properly restored;
switching consoles helps in this case.

Run "gst-inspect-1.0 fbdev2sink" for an overview of configurable property
settings.

Note: Using the fb device requires root priviledges on most systems. Also,
on systems implementing DRM, there's usually only one screen buffer available,
so page flipping and video memory buffer pools cannot be enabled. Use drmsink
in this case.

*** Usage (drmsink) ***

I have only tested drmsink from the console with no X server or other DRM
clients running. Running from within X isn't advisable (it seems to
produce no errors but no screen output).

By default drmsink will assume there is enough video memory for three screen
buffers. The video-memory property can be used to set the amount of video
memory used.

Example launch line:

gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc horizontal-speed=10 ! drmsink full-screen=true \
fps=60

This pipeline uses drmsink's defaults (not writing directly into video memory
but using page-flipping with three buffers to synchronize screen updates).

gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc horizontal-speed=5 ! drmsink buffer-pool=true \
full-screen=true video-memory=64 fps=30 >output

This pipeline writes directly into video memory (buffer-pool=true), which is
fast since videotestsrc doesn't read back from the output buffers. 64MB of
video memory is assumed to be available.

gst-launch-1.0 playbin uri=file:///home/me/videos/video.mp4 \
video-sink="drmsink full-screen=true" >output

This pipeline uses system memory buffers to play a movie but uses drmsink's
default of using triple buffering to update the screen.

Notes:

As of kernel 3.8.x, the Nouveau NVIDIA drm kernel driver doesn't seem
to properly implement syncing to vblank when page flipping and instead appears
to be faking it with a seperate timer set to the approximate refresh rate. This
results in noticable tearing with the vertical position of the tearing boundary
moving slowly up or down (representing the mismatch between the faked timer
and the real vsync frequency). This is easily observable when running the
first videotestsrc pipeline mentioned above.

DRM does not require root priviledges.

*** Usage (sunixfbsink) ***

Example launch line using the hardware scaler:

gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc horizontal-speed=5 ! sunxifbsink buffer-pool=true \
fps=60 pan-does-vsync=true full-screen=true overlay-format=BGRx >output

This should show a very smooth scrolling test pattern. The 320x240 BGRx video
output of videotestsrc is scaled to the native full-screen resolution.

gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc horizontal-speed=5 ! sunxifbsink buffer-pool=true \
fps=60 pan-does-vsync=true full-screen=true overlay-format=Y444 \
width-before-scaling=640 height-before-scaling=480 >output

In this pipeline, 640x480 video output of videotestsrc in Y444 format is scaled
to the native full-screen resolution.

gst-launch-1.0 playbin uri=file:///home/me/videos/video.mp4 \
video-sink="sunxifbsink full-screen=true graphics-mode=true pan-does-vsync=true \
overlay-format=Y444" >output

This plays a video file using a full-screen hardware overlay in Y444 format
(which is better quality than the default overlay format).

Supported overlay formats:

YUY2	Packed 4:2:2 YUV
UYVY	Packed 4:2:2 YUV
Y444	Planar 4:4:4 YUV
AYUV	Packed AYUV with alpha channel (A0-Y0-U0-V0 ...)
BGRx	RGB

The following overlay formats are supported, but only for even source video
widths:

I420	Planar 4:2:0 YUV (three planes)
YV12	Planar 4:2:0 YUV (U and V planes swapped)
NV12	Planar 4:2:0 YUV (U and V planes combined)
NV21	Planar 4:2:0 YUV (U and V planes combined, U and V swapped)

Hardware overlays work in both 32bpp (BGRx) and 16bpp (RGB16) framebuffer modes.

*** Troubleshooting ***

Additional debug messages can be enabled with the generic GStreamer command
line option --gst-debug. For fbdev2sink:

	--gst-debug=framebuffersink:5,fbdevframebuffersink:5,fbdev2sink:5

For drmsink:

        --gst-debug=framebuffersink:5,drmsink:5

*** To do ***

- Test on different platforms.

- An effort has been made to make a running plugin instance reconfigurable
  and to free allocated resources in time. This has not yet been verified.

- Slow video memory read access may impact performance for movie playback
  when the buffer pool in video memory is enabled. Maybe autodetect the
  best strategy.

- Perhaps use a seperate rendering thread.

- High-resolution movie playback doesn't seem to be as smooth as possible
  when using playbin. It may be possible to more equally distribute
  processing among different threads/CPU cores.

- For certain common movie file types set_caps and propose_allocation are
  called twice by upstream. This can be a problem in video memory buffer pool
  mode because we usually provide all available video memory buffers in the
  first call to propose_allocation. This is currently worked around by
  implementing a lazy allocation scheme for video memory pool buffers: buffers
  are only allocated when they are mapped for the first time. This seems to
  solve the out-of-video-memory issues.

- The preserve-par property currently only works when hardware scaling is
  possible (e.g. sunxifbsink). When hardware scaling is not available, we
  cannot change the display out size when set_caps is called; we would need
  to inform upstream to do the appropriate scaling during caps negotiation
  (get_caps).
