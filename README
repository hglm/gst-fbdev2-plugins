*** Overview ***

This repository implements an optimized GStreamer 1.0-based video sink
for the Linux console framebuffer. It is implemented in a base class
called GstFramebufferSink in the library libframebuffersink, and a
plugin implementation called 'fbdev2sink that doesn't add any features
over the base class library, suitable for most Linux framebuffer
devices.

A plugin called "sunxifbsink" for Allwinner-based devices is also provided,
also based on libframebuffersink. At the moment it implements a hardware
scaling overlay for several YUY formats and BGRx.

This is work-in-progress although the plugin should be quite usable in
its current form.

The main features are direct rendering into video memory (instead of
the two-pass memcpy implementation of the regular fbdevsink plugin) and
support for page flipping/vsync, and several configurable properties
regulating video output and linux framebuffer configuration.

*** Usage ***

Example launch line:

gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc horizontal-speed=5 ! fbdev2sink buffer-pool=true \
native-resolution=true fps=30 >output

This line uses direct streaming into video memory (buffer-pool=true), forces
the window size to the native full-screen resolution (native-resolution=true),
sets the frames per second to 30, and the text output is directed into the
file output. If everything is working correctly this should show a tear-free,
multi-buffered scrolling image. Verify the file "output" to see whether any
features were disabled and everything is working correctly.

gst-launch-1.0 playbin uri=file:///home/me/videos/video.mp4 \
video-sink="fbdev2sink buffer-pool=true native-resolution=true \
graphics-mode=true pan-does-vsync=true" >output

This line runs playbin with fbdev2sink configured with the given parameters.

The property setting graphics-mode=true can be set to force console graphics
mode (KD_GRAPHICS, reducing interference from the text console and cursor,
but textmode may not always be restored in case of a crash so it is handy
to keep a utility around to restore the console to textmode (KD_TEXT). Using
the Magic-SysRq sequence Alt-SysRq-V may also help. Another reason for loss
of textmode is that the display start address is not properly restored;
switching consoles helps in this case.

Run "gst-inspect-1.0 fbdev2sink" for an overview of configurable property
settings.

*** Usage (sunixfbsink) ***

Example launch line using the hardware scaler:

gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc horizontal-speed=5 ! sunxifbsink buffer-pool=true \
fps=60 graphics-mode=false pan-does-vsync=true native-resolution=true >output

This should show a very smooth scrolling test pattern. The 320x240 video
output of videotestsrc is scaled to the native resolution.

gst-launch-1.0 playbin uri=file:///home/me/videos/video.mp4 \
video-sink="sunxifbsink buffer-pool=true native-resolution=true \
graphics-mode=true pan-does-vsync=true overlay-format=Y444" >output

This plays a video file using a full-screen hardware overlay in V444 format
(which is better quality than the default overlay format).

Supported overlay formats:

I420	Planar 4:2:0 YUV (three planes)
YV12	Planar 4:2:0 YUV (U and V planes swapped)
NV12	Planar 4:2:0 YUV (U and V planes combined)
NV21	Planar 4:2:0 YUV (U and V planes combined, U and V swapped)
YUY2	Packed 4:2:2 YUV
UYVY	Packed 4:2:2 YUV
Y444	Planar 4:4:4 YUV
AYUV	Packed AYUV with alpha channel (A0-Y0-U0-V0 ...)
BGRx	RGB

*** Installation ***

On a Debian-based system, GStreamer 1.0 and a number of associated
development packages need to be installed. These include:

	libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libglib2.0-dev

Run autogen.sh, then make, and sudo make install.

By default the plugins and library are installed into
/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0 and /usr/local/lib/. You need to set the
GST_PLUGIN_PATH environment library to /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0 for the
plugins to be recognized. Also run sudo ldconfig after installing;
/usr/local/lib must be in the ldconfig search path.

Run gst-inspect-1.0 fbdev2sink to verify everything is installed correctly.

*** To do ***

- Test on different platforms.

- Support more RGB overlay types than just BGRx with a BGRx framebuffer.

- The plugin is set up to use a single source. Reconfiguring a running
  pipeline might not work.
